 ## Data-Driven A/B Test: Optimizing eCommerce Conversion Rates

 ## Portfolio Project Outline:

 ### 1.Project Objective:
 
        * The goal is to run an A/B test with the primary metric being conversion rate.
        
        * Secondary metrics will help validate if the changes made (e.g., add to cart button color for product page ) affect user behavior in unintended ways.
