 ## Data-Driven A/B Test: Optimizing eCommerce Conversion Rates

 ## Portfolio Project Outline:
 
 ## 1. Planning the A/B Test
 
 ### 1.1 Project Goals:
 
        * The goal is to run an A/B test with the primary metric being conversion rate.
        
        * Secondary metrics will help validate if the changes made (e.g., add to cart button color for product page ) 
          affect user behavior in unintended ways.

 ### 2. Primary Metric: Conversion Rate
 
        Formula: Conversion Rate = Conversions / Visitors
        
        This is the main metric to evaluate whether the new variant performs better than the control.

        Baseline Conversion Rate: 5%

 ### 3. Secondary Metrics (based on conversion rate):
         These metrics will give deeper insights into user behavior and ensure there are no negative side effects 
         on other important aspects of the website.
          
   #### Track  Secondary Metrics:
  
         * Bounce Rate: Percentage of visitors who leave the website without interacting.
         
         * Pages Per Session: Average number of pages viewed per user session.
         
         * Average Order Value (AOV): Total revenue divided by the number of orders.
         
         * Session Duration: Average time spent on the website.
         
         * Exit Rate: Percentage of users who leave the site after visiting a specific page.
         

## 4. Hypothesis Generate:

        Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in conversion rates between the Control and Variant groups.

        Formula for Null Hypotheis: H0 : Conversion Rate (Control) = Conversion Rate (Variant)

        Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in conversion rates between the Control and Variant groups.

        Formula for Alternative Hypotheis: H0 : Conversion Rate (Control) = Conversion Rate (Variant)
        
## Sample Size Calculation:  To calculate the required sample size per group:

   Use statistical formulas to ensure sufficient sample size for reliable results.

   Formula for Sample Size:  ![Screenshot_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e2e906e-3da8-41f0-960e-4ff00135a2f7)


   Baseline Conversion Rate ( p1 )= 5% (0.05)

   Expected Conversion Rate (p2)= 6% (0.01)

   Minimum detectable effect (MDE): 1% increase 

   Significance level (α): 0.05

   Power (1−𝛽): 0.8.
